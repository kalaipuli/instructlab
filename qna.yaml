  - context: 1. GENERAL
      1.1Purpose
      This manual sets out the minimum requirements for all Suppliers and
      subcontractors of Konecranes, including those providing production
      materials, components, spare parts, heat treatment, painting, or other
      services to Konecranes (here collectively referred to as "Suppliers").

      The requirements of this manual and its appendices are additional to any
      requirements indicated in Konecranes Purchase Orders, engineering
      drawings, specification requirements, and other Konecranes Supplier
      requirements. They do not discharge the Supplier from liability for
      ensuring that all products or services supplied to Konecranes satisfy
      all of the requirements specified by Konecranes. Depending on location,
      Konecranes also may issue country or local supplements to this manual.
      1.2Structure of the Manual
      This manual has two main sections. The first section Konecranes
      Supplier Base Management briefly outlines how Suppliers are onboarded,
      managed, and assessed during their business relationship with
      Konecranes, and the latter section "General Supplier Requirements" sets
      out the standard general requirements for Konecranes Suppliers and gives
      further details concerning the requirements that govern various types of
      Supplier.
      1.3Konecranes as a Reference
      Konecranes, or any part of the company (such as Demag), can consider
      giving a reference to an external party if the collaboration has been
      satisfied, and the external party's operations are on schedule and in
      line with what has been agreed. If the reference request meets the
      Konecranes reference criteria and the request is approved, a Frame
      Referral Agreement is signed for a specific scope and time. Before
      publicly using Konecranes as a reference in any Supplier material, the
      materials first need to be approved by Konecranes.
      1.4Konecranes Assistance to the Suppliers
      To support the Supplier in putting necessary and required practices and
      safeguards in place, Konecranes may provide guidance to the Supplier on
      how to comply with these requirements. Konecranes can also provide
      instructions and trainings for the Supplier's personnel, considering the
      Supplier's role and risk, where Konecranes sees it necessary. In
      addition, Konecranes will also provide the necessary contact points for
      the Supplier to inform and consult Konecranes on any suspected breaches
      or shortcomings, risks, and possible non-compliance issues.
      1.5Document Revision
      This manual must be reviewed
      • During the first year after its introduction, and then at least once
      every two years • If required, in case of changes in technological or
      compliance environment or as a result of corrective actions to eliminate
      any weaknesses or non-conformities.
      1.6Approval and Maintenance
      This manual is approved by the **Procurement Leadership Team. The
      Supplier Development & Quality Manager** is the owner of Konecranes
      Global Supplier Manual and responsible for maintaining this manual and
      monitoring its implementation.

  - context: "**3KONECRANES SUPPLIER BASE MANAGEMENT**
      Supplier Base Management covers key activities that arise during a
      Supplier's business relationship with Konecranes, and is strongly linked
      to the company's global product, service and delivery processes.
      Co-operation with a Supplier may begin with early involvement in common
      product or solution R&D projects, continuing through repeated deliveries
      of spare parts for Konecranes operations.

      Konecranes Supplier Base Management covers the following main areas: New
      Supplier Onboarding, Supplier Relationship Management, Supplier
      Qualification and Product Qualification.

      **3.1New Supplier Onboarding**

      A new Konecranes Supplier will be a company that has not conducted
      business with Konecranes over the preceding 3 years. All new Suppliers
      must be qualified before commencing any business with Konecranes. This
      qualification requires Suppliers and subcontractors to satisfy the
      following main characteristics:

      +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
      | > •\                              | > Compliance with the Konecranes  |

      +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

      Figure 1 shows the principal stages of the onboarding process. The main
      characteristics will be verified as the process advances, leading to an
      outcome in which the Supplier is either approved or disqualified.
      Suppliers manufacturing components, parts or materials for Konecranes
      (i.e., Direct Suppliers) may also need to complete a process of product
      qualification before a full production run may begin.

      Konecranes seeks long-term partnerships with Suppliers that satisfy the
      qualification criteria while remaining cost-conscious and continuously
      striving for operational excellence.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: "What is the main goal of Konecranes Supplier Base Management?"
        answer: "The main goal of Konecranes Supplier Base Management is to manage key activities throughout a Supplier's business relationship with Konecranes, including cooperation in product and solution R&D, and repeated deliveries of spare parts for Konecranes operations."
      - question: "What is required for a Supplier to be qualified to do business with Konecranes?"
        answer: "To be qualified, a Supplier must comply with the Konecranes Supplier Code of Conduct, have financially sound and cost-effective operations, and meet performance requirements related to quality, information security, availability, and delivery times."
      - question: "What additional process may Direct Suppliers need to complete before starting full production runs?"
        answer: "Direct Suppliers may need to complete a process of product qualification before a full production run can begin."

  - context: "**3.2Supplier Relationship Management**

      **3.2.1 Business Relationship**

      The business relationship is based on mutual respect for written
      agreements and the specified requirements of individual orders. The
      business relationship and performance must also be appraised, maintained
      and continually improved. This relationship may evolve in some cases
      towards strategic co-operation and joint planning of future business
      areas.

      Konecranes will categorize and segment onboarded Suppliers internally.
      Based on the segmentation level, Konecranes may nominate a Supplier
      Manager to assume overall business responsibility for the Supplier.
      Other professionals from various Konecranes departments may also support
      the Supplier Manager to ensure critical
      > operating links between the companies (e.g., from R&D, Production and
      > Quality). Konecranes will ask Suppliers at a high segmentation level
      > to appoint an Account Manager and other counterparts for its contact
      > persons.
      >
      > Supplier segmentation determines the basic rules of overall
      > relationship management and such aspects as the frequency of

      3.2.3.1 Availability and Punctuality

      Konecranes expects all purchases to arrive in the correct quantity and
      at the right time as specified, with a view to receiving deliveries at
      its sites punctually and when specified as needed (i.e., on the
      requested delivery date).

      >
      > Deliveries that arrive too early or too late are standardly
      > prohibited, and may accordingly result in claims or further demands

      > times for its products and services in order to keep pace with the
      > requirements of a global market. This constraint sets the performance
      > targets for the entire Konecranes supply chain, and especially for the

      > and product specifications in each delivery sent to Konecranes, which
      > will submit a formal claim to the Supplier if some requirement or
      > specification is not satisfied. Konecranes expects Suppliers to

      > Suppliers, with a view to further enhancing co-operation and
      > end-to-end performance.

      3.2.1.4 Supplier Development Program

      - question: "What is expected from Suppliers regarding the delivery of goods to Konecranes?"
        answer: "Suppliers are expected to ensure that goods are delivered in the correct quantity, at the right time, and in compliance with the agreed delivery date. Deliveries that are too early or too late are prohibited and may result in claims."
      - question: "What is the purpose of Konecranes' Supplier Development Program?"
        answer: "The Supplier Development Program evaluates and ranks Suppliers based on performance data and indicators. Underperforming Suppliers may undergo joint development projects with Konecranes to address issues and improve processes."

  - context: " **3.3Supplier Qualification**
      >
      > The Supplier qualification process exists to ensure that Suppliers
      > satisfy the minimum requirements of Konecranes, and to gain an

      > A new Supplier that fails any part of the qualification process will
      > not be approved as a Konecranes Supplier. An established Supplier that

      **3.3.1 Background Checking**

      Background checking verifies that a Supplier is complying with
      applicable laws and regulations and has the insurance coverage required
      by Konecranes. Background checks also provide general information on a
      Supplier's operations. Background checking is part of new Supplier
      onboarding and may be requested from existing Suppliers at any time
      during the business relationship.

      **3.3.2 Auditing**

      On-site audits review and validate the management systems, quality
      assurance methods and process capacities of a Supplier. The audit will
      evaluate a Supplier against predefined Konecranes requirements, with
      remedial measures required if the Supplier fails to satisfy the
      requirements. The Supplier will be advised in writing of the audit
      outcome, audit score and required measures.

      On-site audits may be arranged during new Supplier onboarding and for
      established Suppliers. New Suppliers will be selected for auditing based
      on the findings of Supplier background checking, country, industry,
      other relevant risks, and other factors that are critical for
      Konecranes.

      Established Suppliers are audited in accordance with the Konecranes
      annual auditing program. Factors commonly influencing a perceived need
      for periodic on-site auditing include Supplier underperformance, risk
      profiles and business opportunities.

      Konecranes is entitled to conduct on-site auditing of a Supplier
      whenever this is deemed necessary. A team selected from various
      functions and led by the Konecranes Lead Auditor will conduct an on-site
      audit.

      In addition to onsite auditing, Konecranes may choose to perform
      IT-system security assessments, application security assessments,
      penetration testing or a vulnerability analysis on any services or
      product that the Supplier provides to Konecranes. Assessment target
      selections are made based on service type and current risk level.
      Konecranes is entitled to conduct security assessments of Supplier
      services whenever this is deemed necessary.

      Before accepting an IT-service, IT-hardware or software Supplier,
      Konecranes may require that the Supplier, according to its role and the
      risk, provide a third-party verification report, such as ISAE3000,
      ISAE3402 or SOC1, SOC2 or SOC3. Konecranes may also consider requiring
      such a verification report from Suppliers from other categories, where
      their role, risk level and annual spend require so.

      **3.3.3 Supplier Code of Conduct Auditing**

      Konecranes will conduct Supplier Code of Conduct audits for selected
      Supplier groups based on the identified country, industry and
      Supplier-specific risks. A Konecranes audit examines whether a Supplier
      is complying with the Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws and
      regulations.

      Konecranes is entitled to conduct the audit either with or without the
      support of an external auditor.

      See Chapter 4.1 Sustainability -- Supplier Code of Conduct."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: "What are the main sub-processes involved in the Supplier qualification process?"
        answer: "The main sub-processes involved in Supplier qualification are Background Checking, On-site Auditing, and Supplier Code of Conduct Auditing."
      - question: "What does the background checking process verify?"
        answer: "The background checking process verifies that a Supplier is complying with applicable laws and regulations, has the required insurance coverage, and provides general information on the Supplier's operations."
      - question: "When are Supplier audits conducted by Konecranes?"
        answer: "Supplier audits are conducted during new Supplier onboarding, periodically for established Suppliers, and whenever deemed necessary by Konecranes, based on factors like underperformance, risk profiles, and business opportunities."

  - context: "**3.4Product Qualification**
      The Konecranes product qualification process governs Suppliers
      delivering materials, software or parts, or a combination of those for
      Konecranes (i.e., direct Suppliers). Product qualification is part of
      the Supplier onboarding process and is also employed in certain cases
      during the business relationship to assess whether Konecranes
      specifications are satisfied and the production process has the
      necessary capacity for consistent product output that complies with all
      requirements during a full production run.

      Product approval can be required in the event of:

      > •a new Supplier

      > •a new product
      >
      > •changes of product specification

      >
      > •changes of production process or plant
      >
      > •changes of production location

      Initial product samples and batches will be measured and tested in the
      foregoing cases against specified requirements and approved by the
      Supplier and by Konecranes before proceeding with any further deliveries
      to Konecranes. After Konecranes has approved the tests or samples, the
      materials or parts must be deemed production-ready and serial production
      may begin. The approved product and manufacturing process of a Supplier
      must be deemed frozen, and all further modifications to the process must
      be communicated to Konecranes for separate approval. See section 4.7
      Change management by the Supplier.

      The Konecranes Supplier Manager or contact person will coordinate the
      process and advise the Supplier of applicable requirements."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: "What is the purpose of the product qualification process in Konecranes?"
        answer: "The product qualification process ensures that materials, software, or parts delivered by Suppliers meet Konecranes' specifications and that the production process has the necessary capacity to consistently meet requirements during a full production run."
      - question: "When is product approval required in the qualification process?"
        answer: "Product approval is required when there is a new Supplier, new product, changes to product specifications, product version, production process, or production location."
      - question: "What happens after Konecranes approves product samples or batches?"
        answer: "After Konecranes approves product samples or batches, the materials or parts are deemed production-ready, and serial production may begin. Any further modifications to the product or process must be communicated to Konecranes for separate approval."

  - context: "**4GENERAL SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS**
      This section sets out the general requirements for Konecranes Suppliers.
      Sections 4.4-4.9 govern direct Suppliers proving materials and parts,
      and also indirect Suppliers where applicable.

      **4.1Sustainability -- Supplier Code of Conduct**
      Responsible business practices are essential for ensuring long-term
      competitiveness and profitability. The management culture of Konecranes
      reflects our corporate values: trust in people, total service commitment
      and sustained profitability. Management practices are also based on the
      general principles of consistent development, emphasizing the
      integration of economic, social and environmental goals in Konecranes
      business operations. Konecranes strives for the highest ethical conduct,
      and the principles outlined in the Konecranes Code of Conduct exemplify
      the highest legal and ethical standards that we resolve to maintain
      towards our customers, business partners, Suppliers and staff, and
      towards society and financial markets in all of the countries where we
      operate.

      Konecranes expects its Suppliers to comply with the same legal, ethical,
      environmental, and employee-related principles that Konecranes applies
      internally. Konecranes introduced the Konecranes Supplier Code of
      Conduct in 2018 to set minimum standards of conduct for its Suppliers,
      its sub-Suppliers, subcontractors and their affiliates.

      Any Supplier harboring a serious concern that something is not
      consistent with the Supplier Code of Conduct is strongly encouraged to
      report the matter proactively to Konecranes. If discussion with senior
      purchasing management is inappropriate, then the Supplier is welcome to
      contact the company's Compliance Office by e-mailing [compliance @
      konecranes.com.]{.underline}
      See Appendix 1 Supplier Code of Conduct

      **4.2HSEQ Management Systems**
      Konecranes calls on Supplier management systems to satisfy ISO 9001
      quality-system requirements as a fundamental quality-system standard.
      Certification by an accredited third-party certification body is highly
      recommended. Certification of health and safety management system ISO
      45001 and environment management system ISO 14001 are also highly
      recommended.
      While certified management systems are not mandatory with each Supplier,
      responsibilities for quality, health, safety and environmental aspects
      must be assigned throughout the company, including top management, and
      these activities must be an integral part of company management and
      operations.
      **4.3Information Security**
      Konecranes requires Suppliers to comply with Konecranes Information
      security policy and recommends using ISO 27001 Information security
      management system requirements as a fundamental information security
      standard.
      While certification of the information security management system is
      recommended, responsibilities for safeguarding confidentiality,
      integrity and availability of systems, services and data must be
      assigned throughout the company, including top management; and these
      activities must be an integral part of company management and
      operations. Konecranes, or a third party assigned by Konecranes, has the
      right to audit a Supplier's data and information security processes.
      The Supplier must implement technical and organizational measures to
      safeguard Konecranes data, including the Personal Data, from
      unauthorized, unlawful or accidental access, use, processing, loss,
      destruction or damage. These requirements are specified in more details
      in the Konecranes Information Security Requirements Appendix.
      The Supplier and Konecranes are responsible for complying with their
      respective obligations under the applicable data protection laws
      governing the Personal Data and other personal data protection-related
      issues.
      Suppliers are required to report any detected information security event
      or incident that might have an impact on operations, products and
      services, Konecranes or its customers, immediately to Konecranes\
      ([supplier.cybersecurity @ konecranes.com]{.underline}). In case
      Konecranes suspects a breach against its systems or operations and has a
      reason to believe that Supplier information may also be affected,
      Konecranes will inform the Supplier without delay."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: "What is the Konecranes Supplier Code of Conduct?"
        answer: "The Konecranes Supplier Code of Conduct sets minimum standards of conduct for Suppliers, sub-Suppliers, subcontractors, and their affiliates, emphasizing legal, ethical, environmental, and employee-related principles."
      - question: "What management systems are recommended for Suppliers to meet Konecranes requirements?"
        answer: "Konecranes recommends that Suppliers satisfy ISO 9001 for quality management, ISO 45001 for health and safety, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Certification by an accredited third party is highly recommended."
      - question: "What are the responsibilities of Suppliers regarding information security?"
        answer: "Suppliers are required to comply with Konecranes' Information Security policy, implement safeguards for data protection, and report any information security incidents immediately to Konecranes, ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws."

  - context: "**4.4Risk Management**
      Risk management is an integral part of the Konecranes management system.
      As Suppliers are a crucial part of the Konecranes supply chain,
      Konecranes calls on its Suppliers to arrange an appropriate level of
      risk management infrastructure that enables regular identification and
      mitigation of operating risks.

      **4.4.1 Risk Assessment and Contingency Planning**

      To minimize potential business risks, Konecranes calls on its Suppliers
      to complete systematic operational risk assessments, which should
      consider potential risks in the corporate context with an evaluation of
      impacts and likelihood. Measures deployed to mitigate potential risks,
      or their impacts, are an outcome of a successful risk assessment.

      Risk assessments should include contingency planning, covering all main
      functions, production or service processes that are relevant to the
      business area supplying Konecranes. Planning should include such aspects
      as alternative production processes, manufacturing locations and
      suppliers/service providers.

      **4.4.2 Insurances**

      All Suppliers are required to maintain adequate insurance coverage for
      their operating risks, including general and employee liability
      insurance. The required insurance coverage will depend on the size and
      scale of the Supplier's business with Konecranes. All insurance
      requirements will be specified for Suppliers during the Supplier
      onboarding process.

      **4.5Process Quality Control**

      Suppliers are responsible for understanding the intended use of parts
      and must ensure that all materials supplied comply with the
      specifications indicated on manufacturing drawings, on a purchase order
      or on a purchase agreement, and with any amendments made thereto. A
      Supplier must understand the most critical

      characteristics of products, and must have a control plan in place to
      ensure that all necessary quality requirements for Konecranes products
      are satisfied before the production run begins. The control plan should
      be based on the studies of the causes and effects of potential failures
      in the product or process. Suppliers providing serial production parts
      are expected to use Statistical Process Controls (SPC).

      Suppliers providing software are required to use secure software
      development practices, supporting tools and processes.

      Konecranes may require, for example, certificates from time to time
      validating dimensional measuring results of purchased parts, functional
      test results, etc. A requirement concerning certificates validating
      product conformance will be shown on the Purchase Order, or Konecranes
      may request such certificates separately whenever this is deemed
      necessary."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: "What is required of Suppliers for risk management?"
        answer: "Suppliers must have an appropriate level of risk management infrastructure to regularly identify and mitigate operating risks, including conducting systematic operational risk assessments and implementing contingency planning."

      - question: "What insurance requirements must Suppliers meet?"
        answer: "Suppliers are required to maintain adequate insurance coverage, including general and employee liability insurance. The specifics of the insurance requirements will be communicated during the Supplier onboarding process."

      - question: "What quality control measures are expected from Suppliers?"
        answer: "Suppliers must ensure that all materials meet Konecranes specifications and must have a control plan in place, including the use of Statistical Process Controls (SPC) for serial production parts. For software suppliers, secure software development practices are required."

  - context: "**4.6Nonconformance Management**
      **4.6.1 Nonconformance Reporting by a Supplier**
      Konecranes encourages Suppliers to adopt a proactive attitude,
      identifying and preventing potential problems before they arise, and
      taking remedial measures when specific problems are detected. A Supplier
      must immediately report any nonconforming or suspect materials or
      products that may be in transit or already delivered to Konecranes and
      should inspect all previous and current deliveries if the extent of
      potentially defective materials is not clear. Communications should be
      addressed to the recipient Konecranes site and to the Konecranes
      Supplier Manager.

      **4.6.2 Containment of Nonconforming Materials at a Supplier Facility**
      Suppliers must react immediately by containing nonconforming materials
      and minimizing the impact on Konecranes production. A Supplier must
      perform 100% off-line inspection of suspect lots before delivery, with
      defective lots either reworked or scrapped. Records of nonconforming
      materials and customer notifications must be retained for submission to
      the recipient Konecranes site on request.

      **4.6.3 Nonconforming Materials at Konecranes**
      A Supplier must notify Konecranes of any materials that could be deemed
      as nonconforming at the recipient Konecranes site. Konecranes will
      retain the option of requesting assistance from the Supplier for on-site
      inspection or reworking of nonconforming materials at either the
      Konecranes or end customer facility, or at both. On finding
      nonconforming materials at a recipient Konecranes site, 100% third-party
      containment may be implemented at the Supplier, Konecranes or
      end-customer site until the root cause and permanent remedial measures
      have been specified. The Supplier must defray all costs related to
      on-site inspections or third-party containment, and all costs incurred
      in return or disposal of its nonconforming materials.

      **4.6.4 Claims Addressed to Suppliers**
      A claim (Supplier reclamation) will be addressed to a Supplier whenever
      a Supplier-caused issue or nonconformance occurs. Suppliers will be
      notified promptly of any issues requiring a response and are requested
      to respond to claims within no more than 48 hours.

      A Supplier is standardly required to notify the root cause together with
      short and long-term remedial measures for each notified claim. An 8D
      report must be prepared when investigating a claim if the Konecranes
      contact person so requests. Structured problem-solving techniques (5 x
      why, fishbone, etc.) are highly recommended.

      The claims addressed to the Suppliers will affect the Supplier's
      performance evaluation.

      **4.6.5 Chargeback**
      Suppliers will be liable for all costs associated with shipments of
      nonconforming materials. Both Konecranes and the Supplier will endeavor
      to settle all disputes amicably.

      **4.6.6 Supplier Deviation Request (SDR)**
      A Supplier may be granted a deviation under certain circumstances.
      Deviation requests must be addressed to the recipient Konecranes site
      and to the designated Supplier Manager. Konecranes will evaluate the
      risks and impact on customer deliveries of using a nonconforming
      material product before granting approval to the Supplier.

      No materials or products may be shipped until Konecranes has issued
      written approval. Approved deviations will relate to a specific quantity
      or material, or will take effect for a certain period specified in the
      deviation approval. If a deviation and shipment of parts have been
      approved, then the parts subject to deviation approval must at least be
      labelled as such on all delivery packages and parcels.

      Off-line reworking will be permitted during a production run if the
      reworked product satisfies all quality requirements, specifications,
      applicable standards and guidelines, and is subject to all of the tests
      that are necessary to ensure that the product is compliant. A reworked
      part must be comparable in all respects (quality, features) to a
      non-reworked part."
    questions_and_answers:  
    - question: "What should a Supplier do if nonconforming materials are detected?"
      answer: "The Supplier must immediately report any nonconforming or suspect materials to Konecranes and inspect previous and current deliveries to assess the extent of the issue. Communication should be directed to the recipient Konecranes site and Supplier Manager."

    - question: "How should a Supplier manage nonconforming materials at their facility?"
      answer: "The Supplier must immediately contain nonconforming materials, perform a 100% off-line inspection of suspect lots, and either rework or scrap defective lots. Records of nonconforming materials and customer notifications must be retained for submission upon request."

    - question: "What is the Supplier's responsibility when a claim is addressed to them?"
      answer: "The Supplier must respond to claims within 48 hours, providing the root cause and remedial measures. An 8D report is required if requested, and claims will affect the Supplier's performance evaluation."

  - context: "**4.7Engineering Change Requests (ECR)**
      A Supplier may submit an engineering change request (ECR) to Konecranes
      whenever this is warranted. ECRs should be issued whenever a Supplier is
      aware of potential cost savings in a product, process or system (e.g.,
      related to form, shape, dimensions or software), or in the design
      constraints governing production. ECRs should be e-mailed to
      [DG-Procurement-Service-Center @ konecranes.com]{.underline}. No changes
      may be implemented before Konecranes has approved them.

      **4.8Change Management by the Supplier**
      A Supplier must submit a written change request for approval to the
      Konecranes Supplier Manager and the recipient site concerning all
      changes in materials, processes, plant and manufacturing location before
      these changes are implemented (change of frozen processes). A change
      request for approval must be submitted at least 6 months in advance. No
      change request may be deemed approved before the Supplier receives a
      written confirmation from Konecranes.

      A Supplier request may be approved, declined, or approved subject to
      conditions. The Supplier may be asked to send materials for product
      qualification (see section 3.4) before a change is approved.

      A Supplier is also required to notify Konecranes when any change of its
      company management structure or ownership occurs.

      **4.9Material Traceability**
      Konecranes may impose material and product traceability requirements at
      the beginning of a Supplier relationship and before production ramp-up
      for direct Suppliers. Suppliers are requested to maintain material and
      product identification data throughout the lifetime of a product or for
      the period specified by Konecranes. Suppliers are otherwise expected to
      maintain individual product identification for crucial parts and
      sub-components as a means of risk management. Traceability requirements
      must also govern any sub-Suppliers and subcontractors in the supply
      chain where applicable.

      Product and material identifiers must be always placed and fastened in a
      manner that is not easily detached or obscured by wear and tear.

      **4.10 Control of Records and Documentation**
      The Supplier must retain and archive all records required by Konecranes
      (such as production test/measurement results and material certificates)
      for not less than ten (10) years unless otherwise agreed. All records
      saved on computers or other electronic storage media must be backed up,
      and it must be possible to restore files from

      backups when required. All records must remain legible and a copy of
      records must be given to Konecranes at Konecranes' request.

      Classified and other documentation (such as manufacturing drawings and
      customer-specific data) must be processed in accordance with the
      Konecranes non-disclosure agreement (NDA)."
    questions_and_answers:  
    - question: "When should a Supplier submit an Engineering Change Request (ECR) to Konecranes?"
      answer: "A Supplier should submit an ECR whenever they are aware of potential cost savings in a product, process, or system, such as related to form, shape, dimensions, software, or production constraints. The ECR should be emailed to the Konecranes Procurement Service Center, and no changes can be implemented before Konecranes' approval."

    - question: "What is the Supplier's responsibility when implementing changes in materials or processes?"
      answer: "The Supplier must submit a written change request to the Konecranes Supplier Manager and recipient site at least 6 months in advance for approval before implementing any changes. Changes are not deemed approved until Konecranes provides written confirmation."

    - question: "What are the requirements for material traceability?"
      answer: "Konecranes may impose traceability requirements at the beginning of a Supplier relationship and before production ramp-up. Suppliers must maintain material and product identification data throughout the product's lifetime or as specified by Konecranes, and these requirements extend to sub-Suppliers and subcontractors."

  - context: "**4.11 General Performance Targets**
      **4.11.1 Purchase Order Handling**

      Konecranes requires a documented order confirmation within 48 hours (two
      working days) of issuing a written Purchase Order. Deliveries must be
      completed in accordance with the Purchase Order and order confirmation
      and will be rated against the approved confirmed delivery date and other
      agreed terms and conditions of the order confirmation.

      **4.11.2 Delivery Punctuality**

      The rating of Supplier punctuality will compare the number of punctual
      delivery receipts with the total number of receipts within a specified
      period. A delivery will be deemed unpunctual if it arrives too early or
      too late. The Konecranes punctuality target is 100% for all Suppliers.

      Konecranes also requires Suppliers to implement punctuality measuring
      systems of their own for deliveries.

      **4.11.3 Processing of Claims Addressed to Suppliers**

      Suppliers must respond to written claims without delay, and by no later
      than the assigned due response date. The following claim processing
      targets must apply to Konecranes Suppliers

      > 1 Time for responding to a claim with an action plan
      >
      > 2 Time for verifying a long-term preventative action plan
      >
      > max. 2 working\
      > days
